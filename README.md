# pygame_chess
Pygame graphics of a chess game. 
Each piece except King and Queen on both sides have letters
and number coordinates in variable name and comments.

Not a fully functioning game.

Any help in allowing a list of draw lines and rectangles to move
would be great.

Possible solutions

- Loop of changing graphics for presentation of famous chess matches.
  Display loop of black or white squares to cover tracks of moved piece.

- Mouse drag and click of piecess.
  Had problems moving list and movement input.
 
- Enter text input with coordinates to move piece.
  Imported a library for text box yet the game would close after input.
  If fixed it could be possible to input new coordinates. 
  Loop may be needed.
